# EE551-Project: Well-log Measurements Classification using Machine Learning
# Introduction:
The oil and gas industry uses well logs to obtain a continuous record of an oil/gas well formation's rock properties and geophysical data. Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids. The purpose of this project is to use a classification algorithms to identify lithofacies? based on well-log measurements. 
# Data:
The data we are using for this project comes from Hugoton and Panoma gas fields
